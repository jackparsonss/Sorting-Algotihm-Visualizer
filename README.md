# Sorting-Algotihm-Visualizer

In this repository I used the python module tkinter to implement a graphical user interface where users can visually see how different popular sorting algorithms work. <br /> This app allows the user to select a certain algorithm, the speed of the algorithm and the size of the data being sorted

### How to run the program:
    python visualizer.py

### Algorithms Implemented in the App:
* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Selection Sort
* Shell Sort
